Rust web programming is a book for rust programmer




## actix-web dev

- dev mode: `cargo watch -x run`. During development it can be very handy to have cargo automatically recompile the code on changes.

## popular rust component

- **hyper**: hyper is a fast and correct HTTP implementation written in and for Rust.
- **clap**: Command Line Argument Parser for Rust.
- **reqwest**: An ergonomic, batteries-included HTTP Client for Rust.
- **time**: Most users will not need think about this struct in any way. It is public to allow for manual control over values, in the instance that the default parser is insufficient.
- **chrono**： Chrono aims to provide all functionality needed to do correct operations on dates and times in the proleptic Gregorian calendar
- **Iron**:Iron is a high level web framework built in and for Rust, built on hyper. Iron is designed to take advantage of Rust’s greatest features - its excellent type system and principled approach to ownership in both single threaded and multi threaded contexts.
- **multipart**: Client- and server-side abstractions for HTTP multipart/form-data requests.
- **htmlescape**: a library for HTML encoding and decoding.
- **percent-encoding**: URLs use special characters to indicate the parts of the request. For example, a ? question mark marks the end of a path and the start of a query string. In order for that character to exist inside a path, it needs to be encoded differently.
- **path_dedot**： This is a library for extending Path and PathBuf in order to parse the path which contains dots.


We believe that software must become safer; that this is paramount in critical infrastructure;
and that Rust is an outstanding choice of technology for this purpose.

Explore Rust
We introduce engineers to Rust as a language:
Find out if Rust is a good fit for your projects.
Get to know the tooling.
Introduces language interoperability (using Rust in a C project).
Rust for Web
Based on years of web server development, we teach engineers to develop state-of-the-art web applications in Rust. We'll tackle:
The Tokio Runtime
Using dedicated web frameworks like Axum or Rocket
Interacting with databases like Postgres
Embedded Rust
We can cover the basics of embedded Rust, or we can do a deep dive. Topics typically include:
An overview of the Rust Embedded ecosystem
Writing a platform-agnostic driver
Async Rust for embedded
Basic knowledge of Rust (or attendance of our 'Explore Rust' program) is required.
Rust in existing projects
We show you how to introduce Rust step by step in existing projects. Topics include:
Using C code from Rust, or vice versa
Generating FFI bindings automatically, and designing idiomatic Rust APIs
Rust extensions for higher-level languages (e.g. Python, Ruby, NodeJS)
Rust in Python projects
We can teach you to write Rust code that integrates seamlessly with your existing Python code, resulting in more speed and reliability. We'll cover:
Bindings with PyO3
Integrating the async machinery of both languages
How to build and deploy your Rust code to be usable from Python
