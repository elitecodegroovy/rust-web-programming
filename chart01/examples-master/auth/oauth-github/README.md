# OAuth (GitHub)

See <https://github.com/robjtede/actix-examples-oauth-github>.

It is a sample app demonstrating GitHub OAuth login using Actix Web. It needs to live in it's own Git repo because Shuttle (the deployment service used) tries to deploy the whole examples repo if it were here.

Live deployment test here: <https://actix-examples-oauth-github.shuttleapp.rs>.
